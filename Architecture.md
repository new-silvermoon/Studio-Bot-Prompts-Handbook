To use Studio Bot effectively for working with architecture components, familiarize yourself with the role of these components:

ViewModels: Manage and survive UI changes.
LiveData: Hold observable data to update the UI.
Repository: Abstract data access (database, network, etc.).
Room Database: Powerful library for local data persistence.
Retrofit: Type-safe library for networking.
Navigation Component: Framework for in-app navigation.


Generic Prompts for Android Architecture Components

Component Creation

"Generate a ViewModel named [ViewModel Name] for the [Screen/Feature Name]."
"Create a Room database entity named [Entity Name] with properties [List Properties]."
"Build a Repository class named [Repository Name] to interact with [Data Source Type - remote API, local database, etc.]."

Connecting Components

"Demonstrate how to inject [ViewModel Name] into [Activity/Fragment Name]."
"Write code to observe LiveData from [ViewModel Name] in [Activity/Fragment Name]."
"Show how to access data from the [Repository Name] within a ViewModel."

Best Practices & Architecture Patterns

"Suggest project structure using the [Architecture Pattern - MVVM, MVP, etc.]"
"Provide recommendations for error handling in [Scenario - network calls, database operations, etc.]"
"Outline code for unit testing a [Component Type - ViewModel, Repository]."
