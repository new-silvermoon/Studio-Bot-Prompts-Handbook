Here's a comprehensive guide on building Android UI components in Jetpack Compose using Studio Bot.
Here's a versatile generic sentence template, along with explanations of the placeholders:

Template:

"Generate a [Component Name] with [Properties] [Optional: within/inside [Context]]."

Placeholders:

[Component Name]: The desired Jetpack Compose component (e.g., Text, Button, Image, Row, Column, Scaffold).
[Properties]: Characteristics of the component. This includes:
Styling (color, size, font, etc.)
Modifiers (padding, width, click actions, etc.)
Content (text labels, image resources)
State variables (if applicable)
[Optional: within/inside [Context]]: If you want to place the component in a specific location:
Existing composable function
Another layout element (e.g., "within a Column")

Examples that leverage the prompt:

**Basic Layout**

"Create a Column layout with vertical arrangement."
"Build a Row layout with horizontal spacing between elements."
"Generate a LazyColumn to display a list of items."

**Text Elements**

"Add a Text composable with the content 'Welcome!' and a headline style."
"Create a Text field for user input, with a hint 'Enter your name'."

**Buttons & Images**

"Generate a Button with the text 'Submit' and blue background color."
"Insert an Image from the res/drawable folder named 'app_logo'."

**Modifiers**

"Make this Button clickable and add rounded corners."
"Apply padding of 16dp to this Text composable."
"Set the width of this Image to fill the parent container."

**State & User Input**

"Create a remember state variable to store a username."
"Connect this Text field to a state variable to update its content."

**UI Themes**

"Apply a Material Design dark theme to this composable."
"Use the app's primary color in this Button."

**Accessibility**

"Add a content description 'Profile image' to this Image composable."
"Increase the font size and contrast of this Text for better readability."
